# BNB Staking Pool with Crypto Ponzi Process

Welcome to the BNB Staking Pool project! This decentralized application (DApp) is built on the Ethereum blockchain using HTML for the front end and Solidity for the smart contract backend. The project introduces a unique staking pool concept that leverages elements of the crypto Ponzi process to create an engaging and rewarding experience for participants.

## Features

- **Decentralized Staking:** Participants can stake their BNB (Binance Coin) in a decentralized manner, ensuring security and transparency.
- **Crypto Ponzi Process:** The project employs a crypto Ponzi process, where earlier participants receive rewards from the contributions of newer participants, creating a dynamic and incentivized staking model.
- **Smart Contracts:** The staking pool is powered by Solidity smart contracts, ensuring trustless execution of the staking process.

## Getting Started

To get started with the BNB Staking Pool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Thankgod20/Miner
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Miner
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # npm install
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
   Deploy the Solidity smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix or Truffle.

5. **Run the DApp:**
   Open the `./public/index.html` file in your preferred web browser to access the BNB Staking Pool DApp.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts in the `contracts/` directory are the backbone of the BNB Staking Pool. Ensure proper testing and auditing before deploying these contracts to the Ethereum mainnet.
